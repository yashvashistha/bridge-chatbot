    "The provided text excerpts cover various aspects of GAMI's regulations, including licensing for military activities and intellectual property (IP) handling, but don't offer a consolidated view of all IP regulations. Here's a summary of what *is* available regarding IP within the context:\n\n### GAMI IP Regulations Overview\n\nGAMI's IP regulations aim to balance the rights of project financiers with optimal IP utilization, encourage investment in IP development, and protect national defense technologies. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n* **IP in Contracts:** IP clauses in all sector activity contracts must comply with GAMI's IP policy. [4] Further controls and guidelines are provided in separate IP regulations issued by GAMI. [4]\n* **Government-Financed Projects:** Foreground IP from government-financed activities is transferred to the financing agency, which grants the contractor an exclusive license to use it, unless specific exceptions apply (e.g., contractor inability to utilize IP, national security risks). [5]\n* **Partially Financed Projects:** Joint ownership of Foreground IP is determined by each party's financial contribution, or as otherwise agreed in the contract. [5]\n* **Dealing with Government-Owned IP:** Government agencies own IP developed by their employees within their duties. This IP must be treated as an asset, protected, and its usage recorded. GAMI maintains a central register for all IP used in the sector. [6]\n* **National Defense Technology IP Protection:** Strict confidentiality and protection measures are required for IP related to national defense technologies. GAMI works with SAIP to protect patent applications. Registration, transfer, or use of such IP requires GAMI's written approval. [6]\n* **International Cooperation:** GAMI participates in international arrangements related to IP rights, while prioritizing the protection of sensitive information. [6]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the provided text offers insights into GAMI's IP regulations, it doesn't provide the complete regulations. For a comprehensive understanding, it is recommended to consult the complete official GAMI IP regulations document.",
